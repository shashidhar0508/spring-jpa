Tables:
1. Student
2. Institution
3. Technology
4. TechnologyMaterial
5. Instructor

Relationships:
1. Technology with TechnologyMaterial(OneToOne Relationship)
    => Without Technology we don't have TechnologyMaterial
    => TechnologyMaterial table will have extra column "tech_id" referencing to Technology table.
    => We can't save TechnologyMaterial table data without first saving Technology table data(1.Errors.txt)
    => By using "cascade = CascadeType.ALL" we can overcome above issue.
    => By using "fetch = FetchType.LAZY" we will get only parent class data,
        If "fetch = FetchType.EAGER" it will load both Parent and Child class data
    => If we write "OneToOne" mapping only in "TechnologyMaterial" table and execute "findAll" from
        "Technology" table we will only get "Technology" data because "Technology" table doesn't
        have any connection with "TechnologyMaterial" which is "Uni-directional" flow.
    => For Bi-directional flow we need to use "mappedBy"
